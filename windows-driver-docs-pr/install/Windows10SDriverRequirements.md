# Windows 10 in S mode (Windows 10 S) Driver Requirements

This section describes driver installation requirements and blocked components on Windows in S mode (Windows 10 S) .  

## Driver Requirements

To install on Windows in S mode (Windows 10 S) , driver packages must meet the following requirements:

-   Driver packages must be digitally signed with a **Windows, WHQL, ELAM, or Store** certificate from the [Windows Hardware Developer Center Dashboard](https://aka.ms/DevCenterPortal).
-   Companion software must be signed with a [Microsoft Store Certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/the-app-certification-process).
-   Does not include an \*.exe, \*.zip, \*.msi or \*.cab in the driver package that extracts unsigned binaries.
-   Driver installs using only INF directives.
-   Driver does not call [blocked inbox components](#blocked-inbox-components).
-   Drivers does not include any user interface components, apps, or settings.  Instead, use Universal applications from the Microsoft Store, for example:
    *  [Hardware Support Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devapps/hardware-access-for-universal-windows-platform-apps)
    *  [UWP device apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devapps/meet-uwp-device-apps)
    *  [Centennial Apps](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/bridges/desktop)
-   Driver and firmware servicing uses Windows Update and not an updater app.

Finally, we recommend using a Universal Windows driver where possible.  For more info, see:

-   [Getting Started with Universal Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/getting-started-with-universal-drivers)
-   [Validating Universal Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/validating-universal-drivers)
